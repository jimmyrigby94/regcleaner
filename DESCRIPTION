Description: regcleaner is an R package intended to automate data cleaning and item analysis for multi-item scales often collected via surveys. Data cleaning is typicallly the most time consuming part of any analytic endeavor. The philosophy of this package is to capitalize on the information stored in column names to minimize the number of times researchers need to manipulate the data by hand. This speeds up the cleaning process and minimizes the number of errors committed.
